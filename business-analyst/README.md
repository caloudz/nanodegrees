# Udacity Nanodegree: Business Analyst

This nanodegree was granted to me as a scholarship by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. For this program, we had to submit nine hands-on projects which were to be solved with Alteryx, SQL, and Tableau. The assignments ranged from segmenting, clustering and A/B testing to time series forecasting and beyond.

## Curriculum

### 1. Problem Solving with Analytics
Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression.

Project: [Predicting Catalog Demand](https://github.com/caloudz/nanodegrees/tree/master/business-analyst/p1-catalog-demand)

### 2. Data Wrangling
Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

Project: [Create an Analytical Dataset & Create Reports from a Database](https://github.com/caloudz/nanodegrees/tree/master/business-analyst/p2-analytics-dataset)

### 3. Data Visualization
Learn about visual encodings, best practices for building data visualizations, and how to get started in Tableau.

Project: [Visualize Movie Data](https://github.com/caloudz/nanodegrees/tree/master/business-analyst/p3-visualize-movie)

### 4. Classification Models
Use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

Project: [Predicting Default Risk](https://github.com/caloudz/nanodegrees/tree/master/business-analyst/p4-predict-default-risk)

### 5. A/B Testing
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

Project: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch](https://github.com/caloudz/nanodegrees/tree/master/business-analyst/p5-ab-test-new-menu-launch)

### 6. Time Series Forecasting
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

Project: [Forecast Video Game Demand](https://github.com/caloudz/nanodegrees/tree/master/business-analyst/p6-forecast-game-sales)

### 7. Segmentation and Clustering
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model. Complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.
